# Quantum Chess Explained ♟️✨

Quantum Chess is an innovative strategy game.  
It re-imagines classical chess.  
It adds concepts from quantum mechanics. ⚛️

---

## Core Concept

**Main Goal** → To checkmate the opponent's king. 👑

**New Mechanic** → The Quantum Move.  

This allows a piece to be in superposition.

**Superposition** → The piece occupies two potential squares at once. ✌️

## Key Features 🔑

### 1. Types of Moves
- Players choose a **Classical Move** (standard).  
- OR they choose a **Quantum Move**.

### 2. Superposition
- Select a piece (Kings are excluded). 🚫  
- Choose two valid squares.  
- The piece now exists in both locations.  
- Visually, quantum pieces flicker. ✨

### 3. Measurement & Collapse
A piece collapses to a single, random position when "measured." 🎯

**Voluntary Measurement**  
- **Action** → A player measures their own quantum piece.  
- **Result** → It collapses to one square; the turn ends. 🛑

**Forced Measurement (Interaction)**  
- **Action** → A player attacks an opponent's quantum piece.  
- **Outcome is Probabilistic:**  
  - Scenario 1: Piece collapses onto the attacked square and is captured. 🔪  
  - Scenario 2: Piece collapses onto its other square and evades capture. 💨

### 4. Strategic Depth
- The game requires managing uncertainty.  
- Players must calculate the odds of a collapse. 🧠  
- Capturing a key piece is no longer certain. It is a calculated risk. ⚠️
